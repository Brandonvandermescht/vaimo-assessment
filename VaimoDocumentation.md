Vaimo Assessment 2
Hello, I worked on the project for around a week, 
I have little experience in react specifically, 
but I did a lot of research and tried my best to follow the specifications of the assessment. 
I hope it is good enough, I would love to work at vaimo and learn to code more efficiently and effectively in the future.

⦁	The project was done in Visual Studio Code, with Node on a computer using windows 10 and a 1920x1080 monitor
⦁	Use the command npm start, to start the project
⦁	The project's name is demo-project, App.js contains the main function called App and all of the component imports
⦁	App.scss contains all of the styling code
⦁	The necessary data has been fetched from the https://fe-assignment.vaimo.net/ API provided, and included in every component that needs it
⦁	The components are sorted into folders according to where they appear on the page, the components consist of background components, label components, icon/image components
⦁	Comments are included on more complicated components
⦁	The main image and name for the product is seperate from the components and are called ProdImage.js and ProdName.js respectively
⦁	I attempted to use media queries to make the project adjust across screen sizes, but I haven't learned how to use them properly yet
